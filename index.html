                As the simplest design, a bus topology requires nodes to be in a linear order.
                Each device in a bus topology setup connects to a single cable.
                You should note that a bus and linear topology doesn’t transmit data bidirectionally. 
                In other words, the data can only go from one end to the other.
                As with all other topologies, there are advantages and disadvantages to a bus topology.
